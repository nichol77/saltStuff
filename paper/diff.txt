<   We expected that signals transmitted from within the salt
< would reflect from nearby surfaces and be observable
<  in our data, and indeed at nearly every measurement position we observed
< at least one clear ``reflected'' signal in addition to the 
< ``direct''signal that traveled along the straight line between 
< the transmitting and receiving antennas.
< Reflected signals can be easily distinguished from direct signals
< from their time of arrival at the receiver.  Reflected signals allow
< us to probe distances greater than that between our drilled holes,
< and to probe different salt regions as well.  However,
< little is known about the loss in power incurred at the reflection, and
< the signals are often transmitted and received by our antennas at
< oblique angles, where the antenna response is less well understood.
< 
< With our antennas in Boreholes 1\&2, the shortest path between the
< receiver and transmitter lied below the corridor
< where we were working, so we expected to
< see reflections from that corridor.  We did observe signals that
< were consistent with this interpretation.
< The meausured time differences
< between the direct and reflected signals while we were transmitting
< between Boreholes~1~and~2
< were within approximately 10~ns of the expected time
< difference at all depths.  These reflected pulses traversed as
< much as 256~ft of salt, and a discrepancy of 10~ns corresponds to
< approximately 4 ft in salt.  These reflected pulses would have been
< transmitted from and received by the antennas at angles relative to 
< the horizontal as high as 48$^{\circ}$.
< 
< As the antennas were lowered to increasing depths in Boreholes~1~and~2, 
< we observed the 
< magnitude of the reflected signal {\em increase} and the pulse shape 
< become increasingly narrow in time.  
< Figure~\cite{fig:reflections} shows these reflected signals in both
< the time and frequency domains.
< % This same behavior was observed for all three antennas used at
< % these measurement positions, the HF, LF and Hawaii antennas.
< At 90' depth, this peak-to-peak voltage of this reflected pulse was
< x times that of the direct signal.
< 
< This increase in the signal strength with increased depth (and hence
< increased angle relative to horizontal) was
< constrained to frequencies below the bandwidth measured on-beam  
< for each antenna.  This behavior is consistent with the interpretation that
< we were either seeing a side-lobe effect of the antennas at low frequencies,
< or that the antennas, or the antennas combined with a section of the
< cables, were acting as long-wire antennas.  The beam pattern of long-wire antennas 
< (for antennas lengths that are odd multiples of the half-wavelength) have a null
< at angles perpendicular to the wire axis, with lobes at increased angles.
< Since we did not observe any additional nulls as the antennas were lowered
< in the boreholes, and since the timing of the pulses is consistent with
< their source and being the antennas, if the long-wire antenna interpretation 
< is correct, the relevant length of cable contributing to this ``antenna'' is not a 
< large number of wavelengths.
