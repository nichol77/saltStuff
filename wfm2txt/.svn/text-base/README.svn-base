wfm2txt V1.0


wfm2txt: a utility to convert Tektronix .WFM format binary files to ascii format.
Uses .WFM definition given in "TDS Waveform File Format", August 27, 1999, found on 
Tektronix website.  (Filename is "obsolete_scopes_WFMformat.pdf".)

This code should work with all the scopes that tdslog4 reads.  ASCII files are huge,
and take a long time to write - if you don't have a laptop to read out the scope,
write files to binary format (.WFM) on a floppy, and use this code later to convert!
(Test first, YMMV, offer void where prohibited.)
